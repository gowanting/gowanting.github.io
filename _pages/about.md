I am currently a doctoral student at ShanghaiTech University, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Laurent Kneip](https://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/Director.html). My research and academic activities are a part of the [Mobile Perception Lab (MPL)](https://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/). I was also an academic guest at the [Computer Vision and Geometry Group (CVG)](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich from October 2022 to October 2023, serving under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Marc Pollefeys](https://cvg.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Marc-Pollefeys) and [Dr. Dániel Béla Baráth](https://cvg.ethz.ch/team/Dr-Daniel-Bela-Barath). I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Xinjiang University.

My research interests include visual SLAM and geometric computer vision, specifically focusing on the geometric solutions of pose estimation problems for traditional and event cameras.
